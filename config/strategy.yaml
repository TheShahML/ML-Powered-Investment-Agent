# Model configuration
model:
  type: "simple_xgboost" # Options: simple_xgboost, stacking_ensemble
  retrain_frequency: "weekly"
  training_lookback_days: 730 # 2 years
  target_horizon_days: 5 # Predict 5-day forward returns


# Strategy Options:
#
# 1. simple (RECOMMENDED - less overfitting)
#    - Single XGBoost model
#    - 5 academically-backed features only
#    - Time-series cross-validation
#    - Based on Jegadeesh & Titman momentum research
#
# 2. stacking (more complex, higher overfitting risk)
#    - 5 models: XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, GradientBoosting, ExtraTrees
#    - 20+ features including RSI, MACD, Bollinger
#    - Ridge meta-learner
#
# 3. pure_momentum (no ML, baseline)
#    - Just ranks by 12-1 momentum
#    - No model training needed
#    - Zero overfitting risk
#    - Academic baseline that's hard to beat
