# Strategy configuration
strategy:
  name: "multi_horizon_momentum"
  strategy_type: "simple" # Options: simple (recommended), pure_momentum
  # Dynamic switching: if enabled, system will automatically switch to best performing strategy
  enable_dynamic_switching: false  # Set to true to enable automatic strategy switching
  n_holdings: 25 # UPDATED: Increased from 20 to capture more opportunities
  rebalance_frequency: 20 # Every 20 trading days (~monthly)
  min_hold_days: 20
  turnover_threshold: 0.05 # Only replace if score gap > 5%

  # LSTM disabled for now

# Model configuration
model:
  type: "multi_horizon_xgboost" # UPDATED: Multi-horizon XGBoost
  retrain_frequency: "weekly"
  training_lookback_days: 730 # 2 years
  horizons: [1, 5, 20] # Train 3 models for different time horizons
  primary_horizon: 20 # Use 20-day model for rebalancing decisions


# Strategy Options:
#
# 1. simple (RECOMMENDED - less overfitting)
#    - Single XGBoost model
#    - 5 academically-backed features only
#    - Time-series cross-validation
#    - Based on Jegadeesh & Titman momentum research
#
# 2. stacking (more complex, higher overfitting risk)
#    - 5 models: XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, GradientBoosting, ExtraTrees
#    - 20+ features including RSI, MACD, Bollinger
#    - Ridge meta-learner
#
# 3. pure_momentum (no ML, baseline)
#    - Just ranks by 12-1 momentum
#    - No model training needed
#    - Zero overfitting risk
#    - Academic baseline that's hard to beat
